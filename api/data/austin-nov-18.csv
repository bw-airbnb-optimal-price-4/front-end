We run this little vacation rental apartment ourselves. As mentioned in the listing, it's located on our property. It's an above garage apartment that is completely separate from our home.

We're happy to answer any questions about Austin, help you around town, make suggestions, and more if you'd like. We've lived in Austin for more than 15 years and have been renting the studio for more than seven years and make improvements as we grow with it. Thank you for considering our place.

""Culturemap"" is an up-to-date online magazine covering a multitude of cultural events and happenings, with helpful hints on restaurants, bars, clubs and transportation options. GETTING AROUND BY CAR My house is located 5 minutes from all major street and highway routes leading downtown as well as all points east, west, north and south. I'm a mile from Hwy 71/290 (Ben White Blvd), which connects you, in minutes, to I-35, MoPac (Loop 1) and the three major street routes leading downtown, South Lamar, South First and Congress Avenue. It's a convenient location for getting around, one of the steady comments I get from guests! BUSSES CapMetro (MetroBus) Busses in Austin are well-maintained and on-time. They pick up every 10-15 minutes. It's a 5 minute walk from my home to the closest bus stop, and a 40-minute ride to downtown. R","Guests are free to access the big deck overlooking a flowering rock garden and bird sanctuary. The shared bath is cleaned daily. The rest of the house is for private use. Kitchen use for meal preparation is available upon request for reservations longer than 5 days. The living room is available for extra sleeping during festivals (extra person fees apply). The couch is wide enough to accommodate one person and is very comfortable. The cushions are thick, sturdy and soft. The area can be curtained off for privacy. There's room for one or two additional people on a queen-size airbed (can be provided on request). The floor of the living room is carpeted, with a 1/2"" foam pad supporting it.","I truly enjoy helping my guests make the most of their stay.  That said I'll respect your privacy and ask that you do the same for me. If time allows I hope we get to know each other a little before you leave. It's one of the truly satisfying aspects of being a host. :) WORK MODE I work from home and spend a good bit of my time in my office, situated just off the deck and dining area. If you need something I'm happy to help! Just ask. NEW TO THE CITY? If time permits I try to block out a little time at check-in to answer questions for newcomers to the city. I'm happy to sit down with you and look up places of interest, restaurants and music venues and give logistical support. If you're new to the city and would like this kind of help, please let me know! HOST CONTACT I'm available by text and phone and can usually respond within 15 minutes. John, my co-host and I are happy to help if you have questions about places to check out. I recommend using the Airbnb app for communication as it ","HOUSE RULES EXTRA GUESTS: Once you arrive in my home, I don't allow guests to bring friends, acquaintances or any other person into my home, for any reason, unless you've cleared it with me first, at least 48 hours in advance. I reserve the right to meet this person, and verify their identity, BEFORE they are allowed in my home. I reserve the right to decline your request. No approved guest (approved by me only) will be allowed to stay overnight UNTIL any extra-person fees have been paid. If you violate this safety and security rule, you will be asked to leave immediately, you will face serious penalties and you will forfeit the remainder of your reservation fees. HOME SECURITY: As required by Airbnb, I'm letting you know that my home has a home monitoring system which captures clips of activity in the living room, hall and office area. These are private spaces. An active exterior security camera captures activity at the door. There is no monitoring in either of the bedrooms or the bat",,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/98695e39-bae7-4e3d-a5df-4e52f861f4df.jpg?aki_policy=large,,407093,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/407093,Paula,2/23/2011,"Austin, Texas, United States","I'm a performing songwriter, musician.

My interests cover from Buddy Holly to Buddy Bolden,  from Townes to Dr John, and Shinyribs to Trombone Shorty.  My musical tastes cover rock, country, R & B, reggae, blues, jazz, conjunto/Tex Mex, Mexican, African, Cuban, Latin, Big Band, and classical.
